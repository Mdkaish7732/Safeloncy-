            <h2 id="h2Heading1"><strong>What is Partition of Property?</strong></h2>

            <p>
                Partition means the division of property held by joint co-owners, into different shares, so that they can enjoy exclusive rights over their property.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2 id="h2Heading2"><strong>Kinds of Properties that can be partitioned</strong></h2>
               
            <P>According to the Property Partition Laws in India, there are two kinds of properties that can be partitioned:<br><br>

                1.&nbsp;Joint Family Property<br><br>
                2. Self-Acquired Property<br>
                 &nbsp;</p>
                
                (1) Joint Family or Coparcenary property:<br><br>
                
                A joint-family or a coparcenary property includes that property in which the interest and possession is shared by all the coparceners to the property. Any such property can be of different kinds and may consist of:
                 <br><br>
                
                 (2) Self-Acquired Property:<br><br>

                 A property is a self-acquired property when it is earned or acquired by the personal effort of any person. In the case of self-acquired property, the person who earns or acquires the property is the single owner of the property, and no one other than the person himself can exercise his/her any right over the property during his/her lifetime.<br><br>
                 
                 A property acquired by a Hindu on his/her own and by his/her own efforts is his/her separate property as it is not the result of any joint labor of other members of the Joint Hindu Family.<br><br>
                 
                 Property that has been inherited by a Hindu from any person other than his father, grandfather, or great grandfather would have the same effect as a self-acquired property for the person inheriting the property. In the case where a person earns money through practicing a hereditary profession,  the property acquired by that money will be his/her self-acquired and separate property and not joint property.
                 
                 A property acquired by a Hindu by a grant from the Government shall also be regarded as a separate property of that person.
                  </P>
