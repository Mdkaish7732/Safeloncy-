            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading1"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
            <p>Adultery in India is a contentious issue that has long been debated and discussed in legal circles. In a country where marriage is considered sacred and divorce is frowned upon, adultery is viewed as a serious breach of trust that can lead to the breakdown of a marriage. In this article, we will delve into the legal framework around adultery in India, its impact on divorce, how it is dealt with under various Personal Laws, examine instances where courts have ruled on cases of adultery, and outline the steps that one can take to legally address adultery committed by their spouse.<br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading2"><strong>Adultery And Divorce in India</strong></h2>
            <p>Marriage is an exclusive relationship that requires trust and commitment. Except under Muslim law where limited polygamy is permitted for men, it is perceived as a one-man, one-woman relationship. Sex outside wedlock in all personal laws is perceived as a grave matrimonial offence that breaches the trust and faithfulness towards each other. Thus, all laws provide voluntary sex outside marriage as a ground for dissolution of marriage by way of divorce or hiatus in marriage by way of judicial separation.</p>
            <p>The term used under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Special Marriage Act, 1954, is not adultery but, that the respondent has had ‘voluntary sexual intercourse with a person other than the spouse.’</p>
            <p>For an act to amount to adultery it must essentially comprise the following ingredients:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>
            <p>There should be an act of sexual intercourse outside the marriage, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>That such intercourse should be voluntary.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center"><strong><u>  </u></strong><br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading3"><strong>Is Adultery a Crime and Ground for Divorce in India?</strong></h2>
            <p>The legal status of adultery in India has undergone significant changes in recent years. Until September 2018, adultery was considered a criminal offence under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which stated that a man could be punished with imprisonment for up to five years for having sexual intercourse with a married woman without her husband’s consent or connivance.<br>
            <br>
            However, in a landmark five-judge bench judgment, Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018), the Supreme Court of India struck down Section 497 as unconstitutional, stating that it violated the fundamental rights of equality and privacy. The court held that adultery is a private matter between consenting adults and should not be treated as a criminal offence. However, despite its decriminalisation, an act of adultery is still recognised as a ground for divorce under various Religious Personal Laws.<br>


            &nbsp;</p>
            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading4"><strong>Adultery under Hindu Law</strong></h2>
            <p>Under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, (HMA) adultery is considered a ground for divorce. Adultery is defined as voluntary sexual intercourse by a person who is married to someone who is not their spouse. If a spouse commits adultery, the aggrieved spouse can <b>file for divorce</b></a> on this basis.<br>
            <br>
            The HMA treats even a single act of sexual intercourse outside wedlock as a ground for divorce and it is not necessary to prove a continuous conduct of adulterous nature. Secondly, it is the act of sexual intercourse and not mere intimacy, familiarity or flirtatious conduct which is sufficient. It is the actual physical act of sexual intercourse that gives rise to a cause of action. The term voluntary also indicates that the act of sexual intercourse must be with the free consent of the guilty party. Therefore, if a woman is a victim of rape, her husband cannot proceed for divorce against her on this ground.<br>
            Unlike the offence of adultery (as was originally conceptualised in the IPC before its decriminalisation in 2018) where only a husband could initiate criminal proceedings against the adulterer, the act of adultery, as a ground for divorce (as is conceptualised under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955) is available to both the husband and the wife in a marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            If the court is satisfied that adultery has taken place, it may grant a decree of divorce. The court will also take into consideration any other factors that may have contributed to the breakdown of the marriage, such as cruelty, desertion, or mental illness. If the court finds that the aggrieved spouse has also committed adultery, the court may deny the divorce. Additionally, if the aggrieved has in any manner been accessory to or connived at or condoned the act of adultery, or has presented the petition in collusion with the respondent, the Court shall not decree the relief of divorce. Speaking of condonation, it is worthwhile to note that where a matrimonial misconduct of adultery is condoned by the aggrieved spouse the same cannot be made by him/ her the basis of a petition for divorce at a later point in time. Mere forgiveness of the matrimonial offence of adultery is not sufficient to conclude condonation. Condonation implies a complete reconciliation in the sense of reinstating the offender to conjugal cohabitation. But it cannot be implied, if the relations, after the commission of adultery by the wife, become bitter and strained and the husband pursues divorce proceedings.<br>
            <br>
            There is no absolute rule that can be commonly used for all adultery-related cases. The court would treat each case on its own facts and pieces of evidence. These might include children, society, familial considerations and also the economic status of the parties.<br>
            Adultery is a ground for judicial separation or divorce only when it is committed post-marriage. Where a party was sexually active prior to the marriage leading to either pre-marital pregnancy or the man fathering a child, it may be a ground for annulment of marriage but not ground for either judicial separation or divorce.<br>
            <br>
            It is important to note that under Hindu law, the maintenance order for a wife or a husband in judicial separation from each other, who has committed adultery while in such separation, may be rescinded or modified upon an application of the other party. However, the court may still order the adulterous spouse to provide financial support to their children.</p>

            &nbsp;</p>


            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading5"><strong>Adultery under Muslim Law</strong></h2>
            <p>In Islam, adultery or sexual relation out of wedlock is a major sin or Zina. Adultery is a serious immorality against the spouse. Traditionally, a person was stoned to death for committing adultery.</p>
            <p>Under Muslim law, the husband has unlimited and unilateral powers to pronounce talaq on his wife and he does not need the assistance of an enactment nor the stipulation of the grounds for seeking divorce. Therefore, a Muslim husband has the discretion to divorce his wife if she commits adultery. Strangely, for a Muslim wife under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939, adultery committed by the husband is not a ground for seeking divorce, and it is doubtful whether his indulgence in casual sex outside marriage would give rise to a cause of action justifying the petition of the wife in claiming divorce.</p>
            <p>The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939, provides certain grounds on which a woman married under Muslim law would be entitled to obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage. The provisions laid down in the above Act which directly or indirectly relate to the matrimonial offence of adultery are -&nbsp;</p>
            <ol>
            <li>
            <p>Section 2 (viii)(b) states that a woman shall be entitled to obtain a divorce from her husband on the ground that he treats her with cruelty by associating with women of evil repute or leads an infamous life. These are indications nevertheless of a continuous course of sexual indiscretions, more so with women of ill repute being treated seriously as amounting to a matrimonial offence of cruelty. Thus, the remedy available to a Muslim wife is under the term ‘cruelty’ and not ‘adultery’ simpliciter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Section 2 (ix) states that a woman shall be entitled to obtain a divorce from her husband on any other ground which is recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim Law. This ground is a residuary clause that empowers a woman to proceed to dissolve her marriage&nbsp;on any ground that is recognised under classical Muslim law. Lian is one such instance that would enable the woman to proceed under this section.</p>
            <p>Lian means a false accusation of adultery. It is a very serious charge in relation to matrimony. If the husband accuses the wife of committing adultery and the charge is false, the wife has a reason to seek divorce. She can do so by filing a suit in court for the dissolution of her marriage. The husband would be called upon to prove that the charge is true. If he is unable to do so, the court would pronounce a decree of divorce. Under Muslim personal law, the husband can retract the charges as well but not before the evidence in a court is complete.&nbsp;The essentials of dissolution of marriage on grounds of Lian are:</p>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p>the husband accuses the wife of committing adultery;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>the charge is false;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>the husband does not retract the charges despite being given the opportunity</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>the wife files a suit in the court for dissolution of marriage.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>?Since the offence of adultery may be committed in private and it may be difficult to prove it by direct evidence, the parties are to make their respective statements and assertions on oath and can lead secondary evidence to prove or disprove the charges.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center"><strong> </strong><br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading6"><strong>Adultery under Christian Law</strong></h2>
            <p>In Christianity, adultery is considered a sin and a breach of marital vows. In the Catholic Church, adultery is considered a mortal sin, and a person who commits adultery is not allowed to receive communion unless they confess their sin and receive absolution.&nbsp;<br>
            Indian Christians are governed by the Divorce Act, 1869 in matters of marriage and divorce. As per Section 10 of the Act adultery is considered a ground for divorce, and a spouse upon a petition presented to the District Court can seek a divorce if their partner has committed adultery.<br>
            <br>
            As per Section 14 of the Act, the court is empowered to issue, upon such petition, a decree dissolving the petitioner’s marriage with the<br>
            respondent on the ground of the respondent’s adultery. It must be proved by the petitioner to the satisfaction of the court that he/ she had no role to play in the respondent’s act of adultery by way of aiding, conniving or colluding with the respondent or his/ her paramour so as to obtain a divorce decree. However, the court may not grant such decree if the petitioner has committed adultery during the marriage or has unreasonably delayed in the presentation of a petition for divorce or treated the other party with cruelty, deserted them without a valid excuse, or otherwise contributed to the adultery by neglect or misconduct. The adultery will not be considered condoned unless the couple has resumed or continued conjugal cohabitation.<br>
            <br>
            Section 11 of the Divorce Act, 1869 requires that whenever a spouse prays to the court for a decree of divorce on the grounds of adultery committed by another spouse, the naming of the person with whom adultery is committed and making him/ her a co-respondent is mandatory, failing which the case would be dismissed, unless the case is covered under the exception, i.e., if the wife was leading the life of a prostitute and the petitioner knows no person with whom adultery is committed, or that the name of the alleged adulterer is unknown to the petitioner although he has made the efforts to discover it or if the alleged adulterer is dead. Unless the identity of the adulterer is not known, his/her impleadment is necessary, as the matrimonial offence of adultery needs to be proved properly. If the identity is known and his name emerges in records, his impleadment would also enable him to clear his name.&nbsp;<br>
            The standard of proof in such cases is not as strong as in a criminal case and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not required in a petition for divorce, though adverse inference could very well be drawn against the party. If a decree of divorce is granted on the wife’s adultery, upon her failure to refute the allegations of adultery, even an appeal by her would be dismissed.<br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            <br><br><h2 id="h2Heading7"><strong>Adultery under the Special Marriage Act, 1954</strong></h2>
            <p>The Special Marriage Act, 1954, is a secular law that governs marriages of people from different religions, castes, and regions.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Under this Act, adultery is considered a ground for divorce. The Act defines adultery as voluntary sexual intercourse of a married person with a person other than their spouse.</p>
            <p>Under Section 27 of the Act, a spouse can upon presenting a petition to the district court file for divorce if their partner has committed adultery. However, as per Section 29 of the Act, such a petition can only be presented to the district court after the completion of one year since the date of entering the certificate of marriage in the Marriage Certificate Book.</p>
            <p>In order to prove adultery as a ground for divorce, the petitioner must provide substantial evidence to the court. Merely accusing the spouse of adultery without any evidence is insufficient to obtain a decree of divorce. The evidence presented must establish that the respondent willingly had sexual relations with another person, and the petitioner did not condone the act or connive with the adulterous party.</p>
